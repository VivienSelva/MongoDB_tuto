# MongoDB Learning Journey

## About

I am upskilling and learning MongoDB for my job. As part of migrating from legacy software to modern and cost-optimized systems, I am gaining hands-on experience.

## Project Overview

I worked with **CppCheck**, a static code analyzer tool that is set to replace QAC.  
The project requires building a dashboard that highlights coding errors and compares logs for different commits. MongoDB is used to store CppCheck test output data.

## Repository Purpose

This repository documents my learning path and the various difficulties I encountered, from simple issues to hard problems. It covers:

- Integrating MongoDB with CppCheck results
- Dashboard creation for error reporting and comparison
- Solutions to challenges faced along the way

## Key Features

- Migration from legacy systems
- Use of static analysis tools (CppCheck)
- Dashboard for error reporting and log comparison
- Data management with MongoDB
